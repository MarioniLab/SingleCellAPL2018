# SingleCellAPL2018

This project explores the effect of altered peptide ligands on naive T cell activation through single-cell RNA-seq and mass cytometry data measurements. 

## Directories - scRNAseq

scRNAseq/ contains scripts for processing and analysing single-cell RNA-seq data

Within this directory, read mapping and counting scripts are provided in the processing/ directory, quality control scripts are in the QC/ directory, and subsequent analyses are in the analysis/ directory.

## Directories - cytof

cytof/ contains scripts for processing and analysing mass cytometry data
